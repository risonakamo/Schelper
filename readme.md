#### drag tab open
can be used to open many numerically ordered files inside of a single folder in new tabs.
1. in the extension popup console, call setDragOpenPath with the raw string file path of the folder containing files you want opened
2. drag the files you want opened into the extension popup window
    - the files must be in the folder of the string you gave, and must have a number somewhere in the filename, or things will break
